# MachineLearningFinal


This application serves as an example or proof of concept for the application of facial recoginiton software.
The objective I set was to couple a video playback, while recording webcam data to recognize and note the participant's reactions.
The data gathered from the reactions are the expression they are making, when was did the  and how long did the expression last.
Then it takes an average to find the overall impression that the video had on the participant.

This project served as a means to demonstrate an application that utilizes machine learning to accomplish a complex task in accordance to our class project. 


[State]
Currently on hold, but will be revisited for refactoring.
I want to refactor to the code to establish Clean Architecture.
The project is currently unstable, but basic functions work.
Unstable is used here in regards to displaying a video, while tracking facial features.
To fix this issue this portion of the project would need to be integrated into a separate project.
The seperate project would be made to display the video, while executing a shellbash script that runs the python program to intialize facial recognition.


[Software Info]
